# Spam Detector

## Overview
This project aims to improve the email filtering system for an Internet Service Provider (ISP) by developing supervised machine learning models to accurately detect spam emails.

**Logistic Regression Model**\
**Random Forest Classifier Model**

The goal is to determine which model performs better at detecting spam emails to enhance the ISP's email filtering system.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Results
* The accuracy scores of both models are calculated and compared.
* Insights and conclusions are drawn about which model is more effective for spam detection.
* The results help in enhancing the ISP's email filtering system by choosing the better-performing model.

## Conclusion
By completing this project, we successfully developed and evaluated two machine learning models for spam detection.
